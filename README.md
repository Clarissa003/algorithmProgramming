# Our Project

Our project is a simple web app page built with React.js and Express.js. It's possible to import a json list of movies, and through our dropdown menus it's possible to sort and filter the movies.

# What we used

Frontend: React
Backend: Express

Language: JavaScript

## Algorithms:
 - _Merge sort_, for sorting the movies in ascendant or descendant order (based on the year)
 - _Quick sort_, for sorting the movies in ascendant or descendant order (based on the rating)
 - _Heap-based search_, for searching the oldest or newest movie
 - _Binary search tree_, for searching the highest or lowest rated movie

# How to run

## Frontend

1. Go to the movieSort folder and run  _npm install_ to install the packages
2. Run _npm start_ to start the app

## Backend 

1. Go to the movie_backend folder and run _npm init -y_ and _npm install express cors_ to install the packages
2. Run _node app.js_ to start the app

# Other Considerations

A movies.json list of movies has also been provided to test the app.
